# Quantum Computing Fundamentals

**How Quantum Computers Work**

Quantum computers use individual particles like photons or electrons to store and
process information down at the subatomic level. The subatomic particles behave in interesting ways because they follow
the rules of quantum mechanics, which are different from the classical laws of physics we experience in our normal-sized
world. These properties enable a quantum computer to approach computational problems differently than how a classical
computer would. It encodes problems into quantum bits which use quantum property of _superposition_ to simultaneously
represent multiple outcomes.

It is worth noting that quantum computers have an advantage over classical computers not because they execute operations
faster but since they store and process information differently.
